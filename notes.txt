* Updating Paths:
    - because get,post,put,delete can get long, we move it to a diff file.
        in server, instead, we import that file, and then do
            app.use("path", file)
        in the new file
            import express
            const router = express.Router();
            and then router.get, router.push, router. put. router.delete
            export default router;
